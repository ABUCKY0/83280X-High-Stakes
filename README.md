# 83280X High Stakes 2024 

This project contains the team's codebase for the 2024-2025 High Stakes Season.

  - [ ] Main Autonomous
  - [ ] Alternate Autonomous

- [ ] Alternate Backup Simple Auton
- [ ] 2-3x Skills Autonomouses
  - [ ] Skills1
  - [ ] Skills2
  - [ ] Skills3
- [x] Autonomous Selector (Needs to be copied from Pre-Season Development Testing)

# Contributing Rules - [CONTRIBUTING.md](./contributing.md)

# Quality of Life Features (for the programmer)
- [ ] I'd like to have each robot subsystem split into different files, with easy interaction functions.
- [ ] Motors and Subsystems defined in a ports.hpp file, incase the build team decides to yolo where the ports plug into. 
- [ ] Git Workflows that automatically build the code on commit, to allow for a non-programmer to just download the latest commit to test.
